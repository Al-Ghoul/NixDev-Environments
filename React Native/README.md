# Intro
This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) development environment and it is meant to install and set everything up
automatically for convenient and quicker development.

# Supported Operating Systems
This could be used anywhere that supports Nix including MAC, other Linux distros,
however it does NOT support windows out of the box, yet you can use WSL which supports installing almost any linux distro on windows;
for best support I suggest you refer to [NixOS-WSL](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL) project, it is supported and maintained
    by the Nix community.
